# Elixir-Plugs
An E-Learning website created using Elixir Plugs

**The sole motivation for using Elixir Plugs is because they handle a lot more requests per second when compared to Phoenix. You can read more about this [here](https://github.com/mroth/phoenix-showdown/blob/master/README.md#benchmarking).**
